# Search API vs Detail API Comparison

## Search API provides:
- title ✓
- asin ✓
- price ✓
- rating ✓ 
- image (single) ✓
- brand ✓
- is_prime ✓
- categories ✓
- availability ✓

## Detail API ADDS:
- **feature_bullets** (5-6 items with product details) ⭐
- **description** (full product description) ⭐
- **images** (10+ product images vs 1 in search) ⭐
- **variants** (color/storage options with ASINs) ⭐
- **specifications** (29 items but mostly basic info)
- **buybox_winner** (accurate current price)
- **videos** (product videos)
- **whats_in_the_box**

## What we're actually using from Detail API:
1. feature_bullets - YES, displayed in portal
2. description - YES, stored and displayed
3. images array - YES, showing multiple images
4. variants - YES, extracted and stored
5. specifications - MINIMAL (only color extracted)
6. buybox_winner price - YES, for accurate pricing

## Cost Analysis:
- Search only: $0.001 per 100 products
- Search + Detail: $0.11 per 100 products (110x more expensive)

## Recommendation:
For a shopping portal, the Detail API provides important value:
- Multiple product images for better visualization
- Feature bullets contain actual specs (processor, RAM, storage)
- Product variants for different colors/storage options
- Full description for informed decisions

However, if cost is critical, Search-only could work with limitations.
